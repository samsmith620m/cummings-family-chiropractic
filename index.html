                        <p>"My daughter is being seen by Dr. Cummings for Migraines - since we started the improvement has been amazing! Dr. Cummings is great with my daughter (and the other 3 watching!) and knows how to communicate well with her and make her feel comfortable. We love Dr. Cummings!!" </p>
